# *Simple Linear Regression*
  
## What is Simple Linear Regression?  
  Simple linear regression is a statistical method for obtaining a formula to predict
values of one variable from another where there is a causal relationship between the
two variables

### Plot of the Dataset for Simple Linear Regression
   - `Below is the raw data.`
   
     X            | Y
     ------------ | -------------
     1            | 1
     2            | 3
     4            | 3
     3            | 2
     5            | 5
     
   - `Below is a simple scatter plot of x versus y.`

   - We can see the relationship between x and y looks kind of linear. As in, we could probably draw a line somewhere diagonally from the bottom left of the plot to the top right to generally describe the relationship between the data.
   - This is a good indication that using linear regression might be appropriate for this little dataset.
   - With `simple linear regression` we want to model our data as follows:
                                   `y = B0 + B1 * x`
